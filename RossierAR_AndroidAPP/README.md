ScanActivity isn't connected to anything yet.  However, a database is already hardcoded in.  If you manually start the ScanActivity or simply create a button to start it from MainActivity, it will synch to the database, open the camera, and automatically start scanning.  To test, use this image to scan: https://rossier.usc.edu/files/2015/10/Formal_Rossier_CardOnWhite.jpg

A DetailFlow layout isn't immediately understandable if it is your first time using it so I made a separate project file with just the layout to mess around with and understand the code.
